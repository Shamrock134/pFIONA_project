# Instructions for retrieving and using code for the jupyter project **Resolving Carryover in Silicate Analysis on pFIONA using a Benchtop Progammable Flow Injection (pFI) unit.**

## Where to find the data:
* The data used for the statistical analysis is contained in a file called **jameson_pfi.csv**
* The data was generated by Seamus Jameson who was also the author of this project

## Where to find the images
* The images are located in a folder called **jameson_images**

## Where to find the functions necessary to run the jupyter project **jameson_pFIONA**
* These functions are located in a working module called **jameson_stats.py**

## Instructions for running the statistical analysis in this project **jameson_pFIONA**
* This project is pretty much plug and play. 
* All you need to do is include the files **jameson_pfi.csv**, **jameson_stats.py**, and **jameson_images**
* Makes sure **jameson_pFIONA**, **jameson_pfi.csv**, **jameson_stats.py**, and **jameson_images**  are in the fame folder

## Modification to project if desired
* A filter is included in the project under the section "Importing Necessary Packages and Modules" that can be modified as needed
* If you would like to change the order of the treatments you can do this when calling the functions
* If you would like to change the metrics for the analysis you can do this when calling the functions

## Make sure to have the most current versions of the following modules uploaded:
- Scipy
- numpy
- panda
- matplotlib.pyplot
- intertools
- seaborn
- statsmodels
- IPython
